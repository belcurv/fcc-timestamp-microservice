### FCC Timestamp Microservice

**Objective:** Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Glitch.

Here are the specific **user stories** you should implement for this project:

1.  I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2.  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3.  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

Example usage:

```
https://jrs-pjm-fcc-timestamp-microservice.glitch.me/December%2015,%202015
                   - or -
https://jrs-pjm-fcc-timestamp-microservice.glitch.me/1450137600
```

Outputs:

```
{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" } 
```
